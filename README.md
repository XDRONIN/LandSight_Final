LandSight 🛰️ 
- A project Made for NASA Spaceapps Hackathon 2024🌌

-This project is a web application designed to track the live coordinates of the Landsat 9 satellite, utilizing Two-Line Element (TLE) data.
-The application allows users to specify a location using latitude and longitude, which can be selected through an interactive map built using OpenStreetMap and Leaflet APIs. 
-The app informs users when the Landsat 9 satellite will fly over their selected location and sends a notification at a set time they define, reminding them about the upcoming satellite overpass for data acquisition. -Additionally, the application enables users to download Surface Reflectance (SR) data from their area of interest during a specific timeframe, with metadata and .tif file downloads available via the NASA Common Metadata Repository (CMR) API.🔭
